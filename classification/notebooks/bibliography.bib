abstract = {We study the problem of mining changes of classification characteristics as the data changes. Available are an old classifier, representing previous knowledge about classification characteristics, and a new data. We want to find the changes of classification characteristics in the new data. An example of such changes is members with a large family no longer shop frequently, but they used to. Finding this kind of changes holds the key for the organization to adopt to the changed environment and stay ahead of competitors. The challenge is that it is difficult to see what has really changed from comparing the old and new classi ers that could be very large and different. In this paper, we propose a technique to identify such changes. The idea is tracing the characteristics, in the old and new classifiers, that correspond to each other by classifying the same examples. We describe several ways to present changes so that the user can focus on a small number of important ones. We evaluate the proposedmethod on real life data sets.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to solving classification problems by combining feature selection and neural networks. The main idea is to use techniques from the field of information theory to select a set of important attributes that can be used to classify tuples. A neural network is trained using these attributes; the neural network is then used to classify tuples. In this paper, we discuss data mining , review common approaches and outline our algorithm. We also present preliminary results obtained against a well-known data collection.},
